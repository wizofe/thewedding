# Wedding guide application

This is a simple ionic app, created as a small gift for my sister's wedding :bowtie:, in just 48 hours, with no prior knowledge of the [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/docs/) framework.

## Getting Started

If you want to have a look at the code the most important parts exist inside 

* src/pages Where all the main tab html pages reside
* src/app Splash screen call and setting the root page as the tabbed

## Prequisities

Of course you need to install ionic (see more on the project's doc for further information). Except this nothing special needed.

### Installing 

To run and install for ios:

```bash
$ ionic cordova platform add ios
$ ionic cordova run ios
```

Substitute ios for android if not on a Mac.

## Deployment 

[Ionic] (https://docs.ionic.io/services/deploy/) documentation has great info about deploying an ionic app. You can read everything there.

## Built With
* [Ionic] (http://ionicframework.com/) is the beautiful, free and open source mobile SDK for developing native and progressive web apps with ease.
* [Visual Studio Code] 
* [macOS X] (https://www.apple.com/macos/sierra/)  

## Authors
* Ioannis Valasakis aka wizofe - Design and Code
